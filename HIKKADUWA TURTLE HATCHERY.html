                <h1><u>HIKKADUWA TURTLE HATCHERY</u></h1><br>
                <p>If you’re in Hikka, you should stop by the turtle hatchery. It’s a place where a small variety of
                    turtles
                    are reared and taken care of in big tanks.Turtle Hatchery is located on the beach, roughly 2 km
                    north of
                    Hikkaduwa. A small and private research center that aims to protect the endangered marine turtles,
                    the
                    hatchery offers a selective display of turtle eggs and exhibits the progressive development of
                    turtles.
                    There are some spots where you can also get an opportunity to release baby turtles into the vast
                    ocean
                    for an additional fee. The best time to visit here and see the turtles is March through April.The
                    entrance fee is about LKR 500, but donations is accepted.</p>

                <h2><u>The Place</u></h2><br>
                <p>It’s hard to miss as you travel up on the beach stretch in Hikka, north of the railway station. The
                    walls
                    outside are covered in colourful turtle themed murals. The inside is just a series of tanks –
                    different
                    ones for different species of turtles, accompanied by plenty of informative sign boards about them.
                    And
                    of course there’s a sandy section as soon as you walk in where the turtle eggs are hatched. Hatching
                    of
                    sea turtles usually happens in summer and the babies take about 3-7 days to make their way to the
                    surface after hatching.</p>
