                <br>
                <p>Marine turtles are a successful group of animals with a head, short neck, pair of long fore flippers,
                    pair of short and rounded hind flippers and a tail. They have no teeth but their sharp, beak-like
                    jaws can crush, tear or bite depending on their diet.</p>
                <br>
                <ol type="1">
                    <li>Turtles are cold-blooded reptiles (Class: Reptilia, Order: Chelonia).</li>
                    <li>Marine creatures take a morning sunbath to increase their body temperature due to their long
                        flippers and streamlined shells.</li>
                    <li>The only time marine turtles leave the ocean is when the females come ashore to nest.</li>
                    <li>The males spend all their time at sea and little is known about their habits.</li>
                    <li>Most species are highly migratory, moving between nesting and feeding grounds, which can be
                        thousands of kilometers apart.</li>
                    <li>We do not know exactly how long turtles live, but they are generally assumed to have a life span
                        greater than 80 years.</li>
                    <li>All of them are now threatened with extinction due to man's destructive activities.</li>

                <h2>Breeding of Turtles</h2>
                <br>
                <p>Breeding of turtles can be a complex process that requires careful consideration of many factors,
                    including the specific species of turtle, the environment they live in, and their reproductive
                    behaviors. Here are some general steps that may be involved in breeding turtles</p>
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Determine the sex of the turtles:</b> It is important to understand the sex of each
                        individual before attempting to breed turtles, as this can be done by examining the shape of the
                        cloaca, which is the opening through which turtles mate and lay eggs.</li>
                    <li><b>Create a suitable breeding environment:</b> Turtles require an environment conducive to
                        successful breeding, such as an area for laying eggs, a source of water for mating, and a
                        temperature-controlled habitat for proper incubation.</li>
                    <li><b>Introduce the turtles:</b> Male and female turtles should be introduced to each other in a
                        slowly and carefully process, as some species can be aggressive towards each other.</li>
                    <li><b>Observe mating behaviors:</b> may engage in courtship behaviors such as head bobbing, biting,
                        or circling before mating, and typically lay their eggs in a suitable location after mating.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Incubate the eggs:</b> After laying eggs, they must be incubated in a suitable environment,
                        such as the temperature and humidity of the environment, to ensure proper development. </li>
                    <li><b>Care for the hatchlings:</b> The most important idea is that the hatchlings need food,
                        shelter, and protection from predators when they hatch.</li>
                </ul>

                    <h3>PROTECTION OF NESTS</h3>
                    <p> Turtle hatcheries protect nesting sites from predators such as humans by identifying and
                        monitoring them and using protective barriers. This is essential for healthy populations of sea

                <h2>Sea Turtle Diet</h2>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Sea turtles comprise approximately 300 species, each with different dietary preferences. Certain
                    turtles exclusively eat vegetarian fare, while others devour meat, but most are omnivores and eat
                    both plants and animals. The type of jaw a turtle has is a strong determinant of what it can eat and
                    where it dwells. Many sea turtles travel long distances in search of food, and the leatherback sea
                    turtle has been tracked crossing the Pacific Ocean from Asia to the US West coast to graze on
                    jellyfish swarms along the beaches. Despite their status as omnivores when young, sea turtles are
                    considered vegetarians as adults, and their main food sources are algae, seaweed, and seagrasses.
                    Green sea turtles can shred grasses and seaweed and brush algae off rocks, while loggerheads devour
                    crabs, conchs, whelks, and horseshoe crabs. Hawksbill turtles are spongivores, mainly feeding on
                    sponges and hawksbills. The type of mouth and jaw a turtle has, which depends on its food, affects
                    its diet. Hatchlings consume a wide range of prey, but adults have different diets. Turtles'
                    digestive systems work slowly, ensuring proper microbial breakdown to absorb all the nutrients.
